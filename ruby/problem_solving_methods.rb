#Release 2

#1. We chose bubble sort
#2. What helps is visualizations. We used Google for research.
#3. We both felt underqualified, but exciting at the same time learning something new.
# Learning something new caused us to learn more about the topic
#4. From the list unsorted items we would take the first 2 elements by index and compare them first_item > second_item swap the items. Continue the process until this is true for all the items in the list. The output would be the assorted list in ascending order.
